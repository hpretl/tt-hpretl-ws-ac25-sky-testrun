## How it works

When applying a `clk` signal (ideally around 10kHz) a snaking pattern is displayed on the connected 7-segment LED display. The circuit requires a few clock cycles to reset itself into a proper state.

## How to test

See above. Apply a clock signal and then it just does its job.

## External hardware

7-segment LED display and a clock generator with around 10kHz frequency.
